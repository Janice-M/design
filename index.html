  <p class="fs12">As with any anthology series, the segments in Love, Death & Robots are all over the map — but even in their worst moments, none of them are as irredeemably awful as “The Witness.” In just 12 minutes, “The Witness” manages to encapsulate all of Love, Death & Robots’ worst qualities: Gratuitous nudity, tons of sexualized violence, and an ending that’s as confusing as it is pointless. Ostensibly a story about a murder with a sci-fi twist, “The Witness” is actually more of an excuse to show a terrified woman running naked through the streets after fleeing her shift at a strip club. Skip it.</p>
